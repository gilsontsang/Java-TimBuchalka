/*
 * List is an ordered collection (sequence)
 * ArrayList is a re-sizable Array
 *
 * A few things to note. When ArrayList arraylist1 is defined as below, () appears. 
 * That is because ArrayList is a Class and has its own constructor, compared to myNumbers is a primitive type.
 * ex 1. private ArrayList<String> arraylist1 = new ArrayList<String>();
 * ex 2. private int[] myNumbers;
