/*
* Composition has a similar idea to Inheritance such that there are relations between Classes but the overall concept
* is very different. Inheritance has a parent and child relationship, whereas Composition has a central Class that 
* does not have relationships with its' partner Classes aside from borrow those partner's methods and variables.
*
* An example of Inheritance. Animal (parent of Mammals) -> Mammals (parent of Dog/ child of Animal) -> Dog (child of Mammal)
*
* An example of Composition. 
* -> Computer (central Class)
* -> Motherboard (partner Class of Computer Class)
* -> Ram (partner Class of Computer Class)
* -> Case (partner Class of Computer Class)
* **Notice Motherboard, Ram and Case are not children of Computer, they do not share the traits of Computer, these Classes
*   are simply the components of Computer (Computer's 'composition')
*   
* The program below is an example of Tim's composition of a room.
