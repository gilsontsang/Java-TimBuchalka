/*
Autoboxing
ex. intArrayList.add(Integer.valueOf(1));
For this example, we are converting an integer, a base primitive type int to an Integer class. 
We are taking the primitive type and we're going to the object wrapper - we're going to the class.

Unboxing 
ex.  intArrayList.get(1).intValue();
We are taking it from the class or from the object wrapper and converting it back to a primitive type.
